    <p>
      The first web browser was invented in 1990 by Tim Berners-Lee. It was
      called WorldWideWeb (no spaces) and was later renamed Nexus. In 1993,
      Marc Andreesen created a browser that was easy to use and install with
      the release of Mosaic (later Netscape), “the world’s first popular
      browser”, which made the World Wide Web system easy to use and more
      accessible to the average person. Andreesen’s browser sparked the
      internet boom of the 1990s. These are the two major milestones in the
      history of the modern

      The wars put the Web in the hands of millions of ordinary PC users, but
      showed how commercialization of the Web could stymie standards efforts.
      Both Microsoft and Netscape liberally incorporated proprietary
      extensions to HTML in their products, and tried to gain an edge by
      product differentiation, leading to the acceptance of the Cascading
      Style Sheets proposed by Hakon Wium Lie over Netscape’s JavaScript Style
      Sheets (JSSS) by W3C.

          was derived from Spyglass Mosaic. The original Mosaic came from NCSA,
          but since NCSA was a public entity it relied on Spyglass as its
          commercial licensing partner. Spyglass in turn delivered two versions of
          the Mosaic browser to Microsoft, one wholly based on the NCSA source
          code, and another engineered from scratch but conceptually modeled on
          the NCSA browser. Internet Explorer was initially built using the
          Spyglass version. The license to Microsoft provided Spyglass (and thus
          NCSA) with a quarterly fee plus a percentage of Microsoft’s revenues for
          the software.

          In March 2009 Version 8.0 was released, with the first public beta
          having been released on March 5, 2008. IE8 offered better support for
          web standards than previous versions, with improved support for RSS,
          CSS, and Ajax, as well as compliance for Cascading Style Sheets 2.1. It
          was also the first version to successfully pass the Acid2 test and
          included features such as WebSlices and an improved phishing filter.

          started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b
          (mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries
          for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.

          Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It included an updated logo,
          mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against
          man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control
          attribute in HTML5, and a global browser console among other
          improvements.

          Google’s Eric Schmidt opposed the development of an independent browser
          for years. After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired several
          Firefox developers and built a demonstration of

            Google Chrome

          Schmidt admitted that the prototype was so strong it forced him to
          change his mind.

          In December 2010 Google announced an official Chrome MSI package for
          businesses, making deployment easier in enterprise environments. Chrome
          quickly became one of the dominant browsers worldwide.
